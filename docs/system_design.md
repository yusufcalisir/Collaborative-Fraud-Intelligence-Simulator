# Collaborative Fraud Intelligence Platform - System Design

## 1. System Requirements & Goals

### 1.1 Functional Requirements
*   **Decentralized Collaboration:** Multiple banks train a collaborative ML model for credit card fraud detection without sharing raw transactions.
*   **Privacy Guarantees:** Support Local Differential Privacy (LDP) with budget composition and Secure Aggregation pairwise masking.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Protect server aggregation from malicious node model/weight poisoning attacks.
*   **Real-time Collaborative AML:** Generate alerts on suspicious activity, hash identity values using HMAC-SHA256, resolve entities across banks, and build network graphs dynamically.
*   **Canary Quality Gate:** Validate newly trained global models on holdout validation data before promoting them to active production.
*   **Drift Monitoring:** Measure and alert on Feature Drift (data shift) and Concept Drift (relationship changes) across bank populations.

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Stateless Scaling:** All API, graph resolution, and training orchestration services must remain stateless, delegating state to PostgreSQL/Redis.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Active simulations must handle Celery worker restarts, DB connection drops, and Redis failures gracefully.
*   **Low Latency API Gateway:** Screen transactions with attributions (SHAP) under low latency constraints.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

CFI Simulator utilizes 4 decoupled microservices coordinated via Docker Compose:

```

### 2.1 Microservice Descriptions
1.  **`gateway` (Port 8000):** Acts as the reverse proxy. It implements token rate-limiting, request logs, and path prefix routing to downstream services.
2.  **`fl-coordinator` (Port 8001):** Houses PyTorch training loops, secure aggregation, client dropouts, and the Flower/Ray adapters.
3.  **`identity-graph` (Port 8002):** Manages HMAC hash resolution and parses resolved entities into dynamic React Flow elements.
4.  **`fraud-alert` (Port 8003):** Houses the 9-Signal Risk Scoring Engine, explainability (SHAP), and case resolution.

### 3.2 State Management & Cache Resilience
Services write states to `RedisStore`. If Redis goes offline, `RedisStore` catches the exception and routes reads/writes to a thread-safe, in-memory Python dictionary backend. This ensures the demo interface and local test suites remain stable under transient failures.

### 3.3 Enterprise Model Registry & Governance (SR 11-7 Compliance)
*   **Active Symlinking:** Active models (`global_model.pt`) are symlinked on disk. A rollback request updates the symlink to the targeted historical manifest version atomically.
*   **Lineage Audits:** Each saved model tracks Git commit hashes, dataset hashes, and differential privacy noise configuration to guarantee chain-of-custody.
*   **Dual Sign-off Workflow:** Promotion to Champion or Challenger is gated behind cryptographic approval from both an ML Engineer and a Compliance Officer.
*   **Shadow Routing:** Routes 100% of live traffic to the Challenger model silently, logging performance statistics. A randomized 10% slice of decision-making traffic is exposed to Challenger predictions.
*   **Canary Quality Gate:**
    $$\text{Candidate AUC-ROC} \ge \text{Active AUC-ROC} - 0.005$$
    If a candidate fails this check, it remains registered but is rejected for promotion.
*   **Automated Rollback Engine:** Tracks performance metrics on a sliding window. Automatically rolls back to the last stable version if the active model's:
    - AUC-ROC drops below `0.65`
    - Scoring latency exceeds `200ms`
    - False Positive Rate (FPR) exceeds `5%` (0.05)

### 3.4 Physical Multi-Tenancy & Cryptographic Key Isolation (SOC2 / PCI-DSS)
To guarantee data sovereignty and strict database-level boundaries required by banking regulations (SOC2, PCI-DSS):
*   **Database-per-Tenant:** Instead of logical routing via `bank_id` filters, the platform utilizes database-per-tenant isolation. A task-local context variable (`active_tenant`) selects the corresponding database engine (e.g. `cfi_bank_a.db`) dynamically. Table schemas are automatically initialized when a tenant is first accessed. The central coordinator only queries the coordinator database (`cfi_central.db`) and has zero direct SQL query access to bank vaults.
*   **Isolated Key Management Service (KMS/HSM):** To isolate cryptographic keys, a per-tenant KMS service simulator partitions key material into isolated vaults (`storage/{bank_id}/kms/keys.json`). Per-bank HMAC keys (for entity hashing), DH-PSI private exponents, and secure aggregation seeds are generated lazily inside the bank boundary and are never shared.
*   **Private Model Registry & Vaults:** During local training, intermediate PyTorch model weights and local GNN updates are saved strictly to the bank's local vault directory (`storage/{bank_id}/model_vault/`). Only the aggregated model gradients participating in active rounds are exposed temporarily to the central coordinator.
*   **Tenant-Isolated Log files:** Application logs and transaction audit trails are filtered dynamically based on the active tenant context and written to bank-specific files (`storage/logs/{bank_id}.log`), preventing cross-tenant information leakage in centralized logging backends.

### 3.5 Dynamic Policy & Rule Engine (DSL)
For real-time compliance and transaction control:
*   **JSON AST Compilation:** Employs a recursive parser supporting logical combinators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `in`, `not in`) over transaction payloads.
*   **Hot-Reloadable Registry:** Allows risk analysts to add, delete, and toggle rule execution states via API endpoints. The engine instantly evaluates new rules without requiring service redeployments.
*   **Gateway Blocking:** When a rule action evaluates to `BLOCK_TRANSACTION`, the transaction endpoint `/predict` overrides default routing parameters to set `policy_action` to blocked status, ensuring immediate threat containment.

### 3.6 Web3 & CBDC Smart Contract Incentive Settlement
For automated economic governance and fair contribution reward distribution across participating banks:
*   **Solidity Smart Contract (`ConsortiumIncentiveSettlement.sol`)**: Deployed on an EVM-compatible consortium network (Sepolia/Hardhat/Local). Features OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard`, 18-decimal wei fixed math, and on-chain node quarantine mapping (`quarantinedNodes`).
*   **Shapley Value & Variance Allocation**: Computes Leave-One-Out (LOO) Shapley contributions ($SV_i$) after each FL round. Nodes with zero update variance or $SV_i \le -0.05$ trigger on-chain quarantine (`setNodeQuarantine()`), freezing their wallet payouts.
*   **Python Web3 Driver (`smart_contract_driver.py`)**: Singleton class managing EVM connections, contract compilation via `py-solc-x`, contract deployment, automated batch payouts (`distributeIncentives()`), and block event listening.
*   **Immutable Audit Ledger Binding**: Settlement transaction hashes (`settlement_tx_hash`) and block numbers (`settlement_block_number`) are immutably linked directly into the cryptographic SHA-256 audit ledger (`immutable_audit_chain.py`).

### 3.7 Standalone Bank Client Daemon & Zero-Inbound Egress Topology
For zero-trust deployment within financial network perimeters:
*   **Standalone Daemon (`cfi-bank-client`)**: Dedicated Python client binary/daemon (`cli.py`, `bank_daemon.py`) that operates inside each bank's internal network perimeter without opening incoming network ports.
*   **Zero-Inbound Port Architecture**: Firewalls strictly prohibit inbound connections to bank networks. The daemon initiates an outbound-only mTLS channel (port 50051) to the `fl-coordinator`, receiving streaming job instructions and streaming local updates back.
*   **Encrypted Local Vault Storage (`local_vault.py`)**: Protects local PyTorch model checkpoints, training datasets, and session tokens on disk using AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations).
*   **Exponential Backoff Reconnector (`ExponentialBackoffReconnector`)**: Handles network drops gracefully using randomized exponential backoff with full jitter to preserve session context and prevent server connection storms.

### 3.8 Real-Time Streaming Feature Store Engine
For high-frequency sliding-window behavioral aggregations across continuous payment streams:
*   **Ingestion Pipeline Sequence**:
    1. Raw `NormalizedTransaction` received from Bank Connector.
    2. Schema validation via `DataContractValidator` (`backend/app/domain/data_validator.py`).
    3. Transaction deduplication via `BloomFilterDeduplicator` (`backend/app/infrastructure/feature_store/bloom_filter.py`).
    4. Feature extraction & rolling aggregations via `RollingFeatureAggregator` (`backend/app/infrastructure/feature_store/rolling_aggregators.py`).
    5. Persistence to feature vector cache via `StreamingFeatureStore` (`backend/app/infrastructure/feature_store/store.py`).
*   **Calculated Rolling Feature Specifications**:
    - `account_age_days`: Time elapsed since account creation.
    - `merchant_velocity_1h`: Sliding 60-minute window transaction counter grouped by `(account_id, merchant_category_code)`.
    - `device_entropy`: Normalized Shannon diversity index calculated across IP subnets, device fingerprints, and channel types.
    - `country_risk_score`: FATF high-risk jurisdiction mapping weights (e.g., North Korea/Iran = 1.0, Syria = 0.75, US/DE = 0.05).
    - `hour_of_day_cos` & `hour_of_day_sin`: Cyclical time encodings ($\cos(2\pi \cdot \text{hour}/24)$, $\sin(2\pi \cdot \text{hour}/24)$).
    - `rolling_amount_zscore_24h`: Z-score of transaction amount relative to account's 24-hour rolling mean and standard deviation ($Z = (x - \mu) / \sigma$).
    - `previous_alerts_30d`: Count of prior AML SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) triggered in the last 30 days.

### 3.9 OpenTelemetry Distributed Tracing & Span Lifecycle Architecture

OpenTelemetry (OTel) distributed tracing (`backend/app/infrastructure/telemetry/otel_tracer.py`) instruments end-to-end request flows across distributed bank nodes and central coordinator microservices:

```mermaid

    participant BC as Bank Ingestion Connector
    participant FS as Feature Store Engine
    participant PT as Local PyTorch Trainer
    participant gRPC as Outbound gRPC Transport

    participant MR as Model Registry

    BC->>FS: 1. Ingest Transaction [ingest_transaction_span] (W3C traceparent injected)
    FS->>PT: 2. Extract Rolling Features [feature_store_span]
    PT->>gRPC: 3. Train Local Model with DP-SGD [local_pytorch_training]

    CC->>MR: 5. Verify & Execute Krum/Median Aggregation [central_parameter_aggregation]
    MR->>MR: 6. Tag & Save Model Version Manifest [model_registry_save]
```

* **W3C Trace Context Propagation**: Propagates `traceparent` (`00-{trace_id}-{span_id}-01`) and `tracestate` headers across HTTP, gRPC, and AMQP channels.
* **OpenTelemetry Exporters**: Exports traces via OTLP/gRPC to Jaeger/Tempo (`:4317`) and Prometheus gauges (`/metrics`).
* **Cloud Orchestration**: Infrastructure is containerized with Helm charts (`helm/cfi-platform/`) and ArgoCD GitOps manifests (`argocd/application.yaml`) for multi-tenant Kubernetes deployment.
