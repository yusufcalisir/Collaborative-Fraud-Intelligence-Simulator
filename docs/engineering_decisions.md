## ED-001: Custom FL Engine vs Flower (flwr)

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Flower (`flwr`) is the standard open-source framework for federated learning, providing gRPC-based client-server communication, strategy abstractions, and multi-machine deployment.

### Decision

Build a custom in-process FL engine instead of using Flower.

### Rationale

1. **Failure injection control**: We need deterministic dropout, reconnection, and latency simulation per round. Flower's client lifecycle is managed by the framework, making fine-grained failure injection harder.
2. **UI observability**: The simulator's value proposition is round-by-round progress visible in the dashboard. Our custom engine emits progress callbacks at every step.
3. **Single-process simulation**: All three "banks" run in the same process. Flower's architecture assumes separate client processes communicating over gRPC, which adds complexity without benefit for a simulator.
4. **Educational clarity**: The custom engine code is self-documenting — readers can follow the FedAvg algorithm step by step.

### Tradeoff

This engine **cannot** scale to distributed multi-machine deployment. In production, use Flower with gRPC for real cross-network federated learning. The README explicitly documents this distinction.

## ED-002: Synthetic Data vs Real Datasets

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Standard fraud datasets (IEEE-CIS, Kaggle Credit Card) exist but are single-institution and cannot demonstrate Non-IID effects.

### Decision

Generate synthetic Non-IID transaction data with three distinct bank profiles.

### Rationale

1. **Non-IID control**: We can precisely control fraud ratios, transaction patterns, and feature distributions per bank — the core of what makes FL interesting.
2. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic generation with fixed seeds means identical results across runs.
3. **No licensing**: No data distribution restrictions.
4. **Narrative**: Each bank has a named identity (Meridian National, Nexus Digital, Heritage Regional) with distinct fraud patterns that tell a story.

### Tradeoff

Synthetic data lacks the complexity of real financial transactions. Feature engineering is simplified. In production, the same FL pipeline would work with real data.

## ED-003: SQLAlchemy 2.0 Async + JSON Columns

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Simulation results include nested structures (per-bank metrics, per-round data, confusion matrices, ROC curves) that don't map cleanly to normalized relational tables.

### Decision

Use PostgreSQL JSON columns for denormalized storage of metrics, bank data, and round data.

### Rationale

1. **Schema flexibility**: Metrics structure evolves as we add new evaluation methods.
2. **Read optimization**: A single query returns the full simulation with all nested data.
3. **Development velocity**: No migration needed when adding a new metric field.
4. **Appropriate scale**: The simulator handles hundreds of simulations, not millions.

### Tradeoff

JSON columns lose referential integrity, are harder to query/index for analytics, and can't enforce schema constraints. At production scale, normalize metrics into separate tables with proper indexing.

## ED-004: Celery for Training Execution

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

A federated training simulation with 10 rounds, 3 banks, 50K transactions per bank takes 1-5 minutes. This cannot block the FastAPI event loop.

### Decision

Dispatch simulations as Celery tasks with Redis as broker and result backend.

### Rationale

1. **Non-blocking API**: FastAPI returns 202 Accepted immediately.
2. **Progress tracking**: The Celery task pushes progress to Redis pub/sub.
3. **Retry/monitoring**: Celery provides built-in task tracking and Flower (the monitoring tool, not FL framework) for observability.
4. **Process isolation**: PyTorch training runs in a separate worker process.

### Tradeoff

Adds operational complexity (Redis + Celery worker processes). For a simpler deployment, could use FastAPI BackgroundTasks, but that runs in the same process and can't survive API restarts.

## ED-005: React Query Over Redux/Zustand for Server State

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

The frontend primarily displays server-side data (simulation results, bank configs, training rounds).

### Decision

Use TanStack React Query for all server state. Zustand is a dependency but reserved for future client-only UI state.

### Rationale

1. **Auto-refetch**: Running simulations update automatically via polling intervals.
2. **Cache management**: Completed simulations are cached and don't re-fetch unnecessarily.
3. **Loading/error states**: Built-in, no boilerplate.
4. **Conditional polling**: Simulations auto-poll while running, stop when completed.

### Tradeoff

WebSocket integration requires manual event handling outside React Query. For the current scope, polling + WebSocket (when connected) provides sufficient real-time experience.

## ED-006: Simulated Privacy vs Cryptographic Implementations

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Real secure aggregation requires multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Real differential privacy requires rigorous privacy accounting (Rényi DP).

### Decision

Implement conceptually correct but simplified versions:
- **Secure aggregation**: Pairwise masks that mathematically cancel during summation
- **Differential privacy**: Gaussian mechanism with basic sequential composition

### Rationale

1. **Mathematical correctness**: The masks do cancel. The noise calibration formula is correct.
2. **Educational value**: Readers can understand the principle without MPC library complexity.
3. **Verifiable**: Unit tests prove that masked aggregation produces identical results to plaintext.

### Tradeoff

Not production-grade. The threat model documents the gap between simulator and production security requirements. Production should use `opacus` for DP and PySyft/TF Encrypted for MPC.

## ED-007: Tailwind CSS v4 Over Vanilla CSS

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

The frontend needs a dark-mode, glassmorphism-heavy design with custom theme tokens.

### Decision

Use Tailwind CSS v4 with `@theme` directive for custom design tokens, plus a small amount of custom CSS for glass effects and animations.

### Rationale

1. **Tailwind v4**: New CSS-first configuration (no `tailwind.config.js`), native `@theme` tokens.
2. **Utility-first**: Rapid iteration on component styling without context-switching to CSS files.
3. **Custom tokens**: `@theme` directive lets us define our own color system while keeping utility classes.

### Tradeoff

Larger initial learning curve for Tailwind v4 vs v3. The `@theme` API is relatively new. Custom CSS is still needed for glassmorphism effects.

## ED-008: Microservices Decomposition & API Gateway

**Date**: 2026-07-04
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

To deploy the framework as a distributed system, we need autonomous services representing independent components: control control gateway, federated aggregator, entity-graph manager, and risk processing engine.

### Decision

Decompose the monolithic backend into 4 microservices (`gateway`, `fl-coordinator`, `identity-graph`, and `fraud-alert`) orchestrated via Docker Compose and routed through a central API gateway.

### Rationale

1. **Scalability & Isolation**: Independent services prevent failure propagation (e.g., heavy PyTorch training in `fl-coordinator` doesn't block transaction screening in `fraud-alert`).
2. **Central Routing**: The gateway handles authorization, rate-limiting, and request logging uniformly.
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Dynamic path loading in `main.py` allows the codebase to run either as a monolith or as microservices.

### Tradeoff

Decomposition increases operation overhead (4 independent FastAPI processes, routing tables, and service network configs) and introduces latency overhead over internal function calls.

## ED-009: SHAP explainability with analytical fallback

**Date**: 2026-07-06
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Generating explanations for composite risk scores requires attributions for PyTorch MLP predictions. Real SHAP computation is CPU-heavy and package-dependent.

### Decision

Implement model explainability using `shap.KernelExplainer` with a pre-selected baseline of normal transactions, and compile a fallback analytical heuristic if execution fails.

### Rationale

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: SHAP values provide Shapley-based game-theoretic attributions.
2. **Robustness**: If package loading fails or inference times out, the system degrades gracefully to the analytical fallback without throwing API errors.

### Tradeoff

`KernelExplainer` is slow (requires multiple model evaluations per transaction). The analytical fallback is not game-theoretically optimal, but preserves system liveness.

## ED-010: Drift detection metrics

**Date**: 2026-07-06
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

We need to track data drift (feature shift) and concept drift (relationship shifts $P(Y \mid X)$) across independent banks.

### Decision

Implement binned frequency JS Divergence (bounded $[0, 1]$), dynamic percentile Population Stability Index (PSI), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, and model-based concept drift.

### Rationale

1. **Feature Shift**: PSI bucketed dynamically by the reference distribution's quantiles isolates shifts accurately.
2. **Concept Shift**: Training a simple classifier on Reference Bank A and evaluating it on Bank B maps changes in predictions ($P(Y \mid X)$) effectively.

### Tradeoff

Percentile-based binning ignores actual distribution values that fall completely outside the bin boundaries. Epsilon padding is needed to avoid zero division.

## ED-011: Model registry and versioning with Canary Promotion Gate

**Date**: 2026-07-08
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Aggregated models can degrade due to data drift, malicious clients (Byzantine poisoning), or convergence failure. We need to prevent poor models from going live.

### Decision

Build a versioned `ModelRegistry` with file-backed storage, and implement an automated **Canary Promotion Gate** checking if candidate models degrade performance.

### Rationale

1. **Canary Gate**: A newly aggregated candidate is promoted to active (`global_model.pt`) *only* if its validation AUC-ROC matches or exceeds the current active model's AUC-ROC minus a tolerance (`0.005`).
2. **Rollback Ability**: Historical model states can be restored atomically via `/rollback/{version}`, updating symlinks instantly.

### Tradeoff

Requires storing previous state binaries on disk and running model evaluations at the end of each round, slightly increasing round duration.

## ED-012: Property-Based Verification (Hypothesis) and Scientific Benchmarking

**Date**: 2026-07-10
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Validating mathematical correctness and resilience requires verifying general code invariants and testing models empirically on public datasets.

### Decision

Implement property-based tests using `hypothesis` to check mathematical invariants, and build a standalone `benchmark.py` running on the European cardholders dataset.

### Rationale

1. **Invariant Testing**: Hypothesis generates edge cases to falsify code assumptions (such as secure aggregation mask cancellation under float errors).
2. **Empirical Validation**: Running the model on real data validates Krum and Median robustness under poisoning.

### Tradeoff

Property-based testing is slower than simple unit tests. The real dataset benchmark is heavy and requires downloading a ~150MB CSV.

## ED-013: Smart Contract Web3 / CBDC Incentive Settlement vs In-Memory Ledger

**Date**: 2026-07-21
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Cross-bank federated collaboration requires economic incentives (Shapley payout distribution) to prevent free-riding. In-memory virtual ledgers lack financial trust, auditability, and decentralized enforcement.

### Decision

Implement on-chain automated payouts using an EVM Solidity smart contract (`ConsortiumIncentiveSettlement.sol`) integrated via Web3 (`smart_contract_driver.py`).

### Rationale

1. **Decentralized Trust**: Payouts are executed on-chain via smart contracts using 18-decimal wei fixed math, removing central coordinator manipulation.
2. **Automated Quarantine**: Nodes with negative contribution ($SV_i \le -0.05$) or zero variance update attacks are quarantined on-chain (`setNodeQuarantine()`), freezing their wallet claims.
3. **Immutable Audit Binding**: Settlement transaction hashes (`settlement_tx_hash`) and block numbers are recorded immutably in the SHA-256 audit ledger.

### Tradeoff

Introduces EVM runtime dependency (`web3`, `py-solc-x`) and gas costs/latency during automated transaction execution. Fallback drivers are provided when an EVM node is offline.

## ED-014: Zero-Inbound Port Egress Bank Client Daemon Architecture

**Date**: 2026-07-21
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Enterprise bank firewalls strictly forbid opening inbound listening ports to external traffic (such as the central FL coordinator).

### Decision

Deploy a standalone client daemon (`cfi-bank-client`) inside bank enclaves that communicates strictly via outbound-only mTLS connections to the central coordinator.

### Rationale

1. **Zero-Inbound Port Compliance**: Satisfies strict financial security policies by preventing incoming connections through perimeter firewalls.
2. **Local Vault Protection**: Local PyTorch model artifacts, key material, and session state are encrypted on disk with AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations).
3. **Resilient Reconnection**: `ExponentialBackoffReconnector` manages network dropouts using exponential backoff with full jitter.

### Tradeoff

Long-lived streaming outbound channels require heartbeats and session token management to handle transient network drops.
